  Hey, it's me Gustavo:exclamation:
</h1>

I am passionate about writing. 
A lot. 
I started with articles, [features](https://rollingstone.uol.com.br/edicao/50/ruanda-entre-o-ceu-e-o-inferno/) and a [book](https://www.amazon.com.br/Rosa-Pó-Histórias-Bósnia-Pós-Genoc%C3%ADdio/dp/8563876082/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_pt_BR=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&dchild=1&keywords=da+rosa+ao+pó&qid=1620154911&s=books&sr=1-1) as a journalist, an occupation I exercised over the past 14 years.
Now life has taken my to the coding path - which at the end of the day is also all about writing clearly and concisely, isn't it? 

Combining my excitement for reading and researching along with my newfound passion of coding I turned the words written by Sandi Metz in ***Practial Object-Oriented Design in Ruby*** on programmers as a sort of mantra to live by: 
 
 > *We want to do our best work. We want our work to have meaning. We want to have fun along the way.*
 
 ### 6 things you should know about me:
